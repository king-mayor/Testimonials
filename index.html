                            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
                                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                                weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've
                        never written a line of code. I needed
                        some structure from professionals
                        who can help me learn programming
                        step by step. I was encouraged to 
                        enroll by a former student of theirs 
                        who can only say wonderful things
                        about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not
                        disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                        and I never had to wait for long for 
                        assistance. The agile team project, in 
                        particular, was outstanding. It took 
                        my learning to the next level in a way
                        that no tutorial could ever have. Infact,
                        I've often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my
                        development experience. It certainly
                        helped me land a job as a full-stack 
                        devloper after receiving multiple
                        offers. 100% recommend!"
